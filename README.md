# TriviaGame
This trivia assignment is an extension to the previous javascript & jquery homework. New jquery/javascript methods such as time increments, clearing interals, and the use of radio inputs were introduced and implemented. Students were tasked to create a trivia game where the program would run a decrementing timer, display/hide certain elements at certain times, calculate results, and display results through jquery/javascript methods.<br><br>
